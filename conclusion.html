            Today, computing has grown rapidly from being confined to one place. With portable computing, people can
            work comfortably wherever they want as long as communication and security concerns are properly taken into
            account. In light of this, the presence of high-speed connections has also promoted the use of mobile
            computing. As a continuously growing and emerging technology, mobile computing will continue to be an
            essential service in computing and ICT.
            It is estimated that within about five years, the number of mobile computing devices will be around 10
            billion, or 1.5 per person on Earth (Ernst & Young "Bring" 1). The field of mobile computing has become more
            widespread throughout our daily life. This can be seen by increasing the number of smartphone users from 114
            million to 250 million in only one year period between 2012 and 2013 (Okoye). Additionally, according to
            Okoye Research, 78% of adults within the U.S. have a smartphone. Today, almost everyone uses mobile
            computing in some form or form.
