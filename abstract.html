            Mobile computing is a system in which a computer has everything necessary. Accessories such as files and programs are moved to the field. It is a system through which one can use a computing device even when a person is being mobile and thus change the location. Portability is one important aspect of the system. Cell phones are used to collect scientific data from remote and isolated locations that cannot be retrieved by other means. Scientists have begun to use mobile devices and the Internet-based applications to systematically explore interesting scientific aspects of their surroundings, ranging from climate change and environmental pollution to earthquakes. This mobile revolution enables new ideas and innovations to spread more quickly and efficiently. Here we will discuss in a profile on mobile computing technology, sensor, and application challenges.
