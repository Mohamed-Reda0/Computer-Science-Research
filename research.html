        <p>
            Mobile computing is a class of computing systems where the computer and all necessary files and programs are
            taken in the field [1]. Several types of mobile phones, computers have been introduced since 1990, including
            wearable computers, personal digital assistant (PDA), enterprise digital assistant (EDA), smartphone,
            carpenters and UMPCs. Mobile computing has three aspects, (1) mobile communication (2) hardware (3) the
            program. The first aspect deals with communication issues in infrastructure and ad hoc networks
            As well as the characteristics of communication, protocols, data formats and actual technologies. The second
            aspect focuses on devices, i.e. mobile devices or device components. The third side deals with the
            characteristics and requirements of mobile phone applications.

        <h2 style="padding: 0 0 15px 15px;">Definition mobile computing</h2>
        <p>
            Mobile computing, or what is sometimes referred to as nomad computing, is defined as the use of portable
            computing devices with mobile communication technologies (Rouse). Portable computing is a technology that
            allows the transfer of data, audio and video over a computer or other wireless device without the need to
            connect to a fixed physical link (Livingston). Mobile computing uses a number of different ways to connect
            to the network. Some of these methods include the Internet, intranet, WAN, LAN, WLAN, and a number of other
            related methods

        <p>
            the 2010 ISACA white paper on mobile device security identifies the following seven types of items as mobile
            computing devices:
            <br> 1. Smartphones (ie iPhone) <br> 2. Laptops (laptops) <br> 3. Tablet PCs (ie iPad) <br> 4 - Mobile
            Digital Assistants (PDAs) <br> 5. USB Portable Storage Devices (Portable Universal Serial Storage Devices) <br> 6.
            RFID devices <br> 7. Infrared devices (IrDA) <br>

        <h2 style="padding: 0 0 15px 15px;">History of mobile computing </h2>
        <p>
            In 1894, Guglielmo Marconi, the father of radio, was the first person to produce long-distance radio waves,
            marking the beginning of both wireless and mobile computing technology. The first wireless network was
            completed in Germany in 1958. In 1983, he entered the mobile computing industry by Motorola's invention of
            the world's first personal cell phone (Livingston). This invention simultaneously represents the
            establishment of the commercial cellular services market

        <h2 style="padding: 0 0 15px 15px;">Mobile Computing Advantages and Threats</h2>
        <img src="images/3.jpg" alt="3">
        <p>
            There are a number of benefits associated with mobile computing including the ability for users to connect
            to the Internet anywhere, anytime. An additional advantage of mobile computing is that it provides the
            ability to deliver mobile communications to remote areas without any pre-existing infrastructure at low cost
            ("mobile computing: study" 4).

                <td>1- Increasing productivity - Mobile devices can be used in the field of different companies, thus
                    reducing time and cost for customers and themselves</td>
                <td>1-quality of connectivity- as one of the disadvantages, mobile devices will need
                    either WiFi connectivity or mobile network connectivity such as GPRS, 3G and in some countries even
                    4G connectivity  that is why this is a disadvantage because if you are not near any of these
                    connections your access to the internet is very limited.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2- Entertainment- Mobile devices can be used for entertainment purposes, for personal and even for
                    presentations to people and clients</td>
                <td>2-security concerns- Mobile VPNs are unsafe to connect to, and also syncing devices might also lead
                    to security concerns. accessing a WiFi network can also be risky because WPA and WEP security can be
                    bypassed easily.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>3- Portability- this would be one of the main advantages of mobile computing, you are not restricted
                    to one location in order for you to get jobs done or even access email on the go</td>
                <td>3-Power Consumption- due to the use of batteries in these devices, these do not tend to last long,
                    if in a situation where there is  no source of power for charging then that will certainly be a
                    letdown.</td>
